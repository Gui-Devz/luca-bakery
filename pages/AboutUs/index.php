          At Luca’s Loaves, we believe great bread starts with passion and quality.

          Founded by Luca, a baker with a love for artisan sourdough, our bakery is dedicated to crafting fresh, delicious bread and baked treats using traditional methods and natural ingredients. Every loaf is made with care, baked daily, and served with a smile.

          We take pride in being part of the local community, offering warm service and wholesome food that brings people together.

          Whether you’re here for a crusty sourdough, a sweet treat, or just the smell of fresh bread—we’re glad to have you.

          <span>Taste the difference. Love the loaf.</span>
